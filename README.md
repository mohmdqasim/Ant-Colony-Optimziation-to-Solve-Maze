This is the sample input file 'S' as Starting point, 'E' as ending point, 'B' as blocked point and 'O' as openend point. which can be visited.

After the run, this is the simulation of that file and the final path found. Where black displays the block points, white displays the open points, red is the path while Green is teh starting point and Blue is the ending point of the path.
